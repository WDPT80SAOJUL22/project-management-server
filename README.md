# Project Management Server

Project created as a guide for cohort 80 at Ironhack São Paulo.

## How to use

- fork this repository
- clone

```
npm i
```

If you don't have a `.env` file, don't worry, there are fallbacks to the env variables.
The only thing you need beyond the dependencies is

- mongo installed locally OR a ATLAS_URI at the `.env` file.
- nodemon installed globally.
